# MagneticSwimmer-LieBrackets

Wolfram Mathematica code for computing Lie brackets, supporting the results in the paper ["Non-Locally Controllable but Trackable Magnetic Head Flagellated Swimmer"](https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXX).

## Description

This repository provides scripts to reproduce the mathematical derivations and analyses of the swimmerâ€™s controllability properties. 

## Usage

To run the code, make sure you have Mathematica installed and then load the main script:

```wolfram
Get["2links_mathematica.m"];
